## What You Should Back Up (Before Reset / Downgrade)

Backing up **everything important** is critical before resetting, downgrading, or flashing firmware. Some data **cannot be recovered** once lost.
>While most of this is common sense, not everyone is familiar with the full backup process. If you are unsure, consider watching a YouTube tutorial on backing up your data to a PC or spare phone before proceeding.
